    "> **Requests** is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings. (...) **Requests** allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. Thereâ€™s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to urllib3. (text from **https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/**, 2020-09-07)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Beautiful Soup** is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.
