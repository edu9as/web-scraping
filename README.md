# web-scraping
Some notebooks I'm writting for web scraping.

sports-webs.ipynb  was one  of my  first  projects in web-scraping.  It was very 
simple: the aim was to  extract the titles of all  news in www.marca.com. It did
not bring any  value by itself, but it laid the foundations for  the creation of
the next notebook.

Scraping-Marca-and-El-Pais.ipynb  allow the  user to  read all the  news in both
newspapers, www.marca.com and www.elpais.com, just by typing "y"+Ãˆnter. Compared
to accessing  the news using a browser,  it is very fast and  skips all adverts,
which are two important benefits.  On the other hand, the news in the console do
not appear  formatted as in a browser, and  the images  are not shown  because I
think it is not necessary.
